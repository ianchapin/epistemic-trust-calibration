# Ambiguity Types

Ambiguity is not a single phenomenon. Different kinds of ambiguity arise from different sources, and they fail in different ways.

When ambiguity is left untyped, disagreements often become personal, moral, or ideological. People argue inside the ambiguity without realizing they are operating on different assumptions.

This folder describes several common types of ambiguity that arise whenever representations are used to think, communicate, or act.

The goal is not to eliminate ambiguity. That is impossible.
The goal is to recognize *which kind* of ambiguity is present, so trust and confidence can be calibrated appropriately.

## Why Typing Ambiguity Matters

If ambiguity is not explicitly identified:
- confidence can silently inflate
- representations are used beyond their limits
- disagreement appears deeper than it is
- judgment is disguised as certainty

Typing ambiguity allows us to say:
- what kind of uncertainty we are dealing with
- what kinds of resolution are possible
- where judgment must enter
- where confidence should be limited

Different ambiguity types require different responses. Treating them as the same leads to predictable failure modes.

## Ambiguity Types Used in This Framework

This framework uses the following non-exhaustive ambiguity types:

- **Semantic Ambiguity**  
  Ambiguity arising from differences in meaning of words or symbols.

- **Contextual Ambiguity**  
  Ambiguity arising from using a representation outside the context it was created for.

- **Mapping Ambiguity**  
  Ambiguity arising from unclear or unstable relationships between a representation and what it refers to.

- **Structural Ambiguity**  
  Ambiguity arising from the limits, assumptions, and simplifications of a representation.

- **Normative Ambiguity**  
  Ambiguity arising from unclear, conflicting, or implicit values and goals.

Each type is described in its own file.

## Important Constraints

A single situation may involve multiple ambiguity types at once.

Typing ambiguity does not resolve disagreement by itself.
It clarifies *where* disagreement lives and *what kind* of judgment is required.

Ambiguity is not a flaw to be removed.
It is a signal that representations have reached their limits.

## Relationship to the Framework

Ambiguity typing supports the broader goals of the framework by:
- preventing silent overconfidence
- making limits explicit
- preserving judgment
- avoiding false consensus

It is a diagnostic tool, not a decision procedure.

## Closing Note

When discussions stall or escalate despite apparent agreement, ambiguity is often present.

Before seeking resolution, it is often more useful to ask:
> “What kind of ambiguity are we actually dealing with?”
