# AI-Generated Outputs

This use case explores how epistemic trust calibration *might* apply to AI-generated outputs such as text, summaries, explanations, or recommendations.

This is a speculative example. It does not claim to make AI systems correct, safe, or reliable.

---

## Why This Is Interesting

AI systems often produce outputs that are:
- fluent
- confident
- well-structured
- delivered quickly

These qualities make them easy for humans to over-trust, especially under time pressure or cognitive load.

The risk is not that the output is always wrong, but that it is treated as more reliable or authoritative than it deserves.

---

## Common Failure Mode

A common failure mode is **scope creep**.

Outputs intended for:
- exploration
- brainstorming
- explanation
- pattern surfacing

are later used for:
- decision-making
- justification
- high-stakes action

without any explicit reassessment of trust.

Fluency is mistaken for reliability.
Confidence is mistaken for correctness.

---

## Relevant Ambiguity Types

This scenario often involves multiple ambiguity types at once:

- **Mapping Ambiguity**  
  The relationship between the output and real-world truth is indirect and unstable.

- **Contextual Ambiguity**  
  Outputs are used outside the context they were generated for.

- **Structural Ambiguity**  
  The model necessarily omits information, edge cases, and latent assumptions.

- **Semantic Ambiguity**  
  Terms used in outputs may carry different meanings for different readers.

## How the Framework Might Apply

The framework suggests **annotating outputs rather than modifying them**.

An annotation might include:
- intended use (e.g., exploratory, explanatory)
- confidence tier (how much reliance is appropriate)
- relevant ambiguity types
- known failure modes
- explicit judgment handoff points

The content of the output remains unchanged.
Only its *use* is constrained.

---

## What This Does Not Do

This approach does not:
- verify correctness
- prevent misuse
- remove responsibility
- replace domain expertise
- make outputs safe by default

It only makes trust assumptions visible.

---

## Limits of This Application

This framework cannot resolve:
- whether an output is true
- whether it should be acted on
- how much risk is acceptable

Those decisions require human judgment and accountability.

If annotation is treated as a guarantee rather than a warning,
the framework has failed.

---

## Why This Is Speculative

This use case assumes:
- humans will read annotations
- organizations will respect scope limits
- judgment will not be outsourced to the framework itself

These assumptions may not hold.

If annotation becomes performative or ignored, it adds little value.
