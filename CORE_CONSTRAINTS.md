# Core Constraints

This file defines the invariant constraints of the Epistemic Trust Calibration framework.
These constraints are not conclusions, recommendations, or beliefs.
They describe structural conditions that hold whenever representations are used to think, communicate, or act.

This file is intended to change rarely.

## Structural Invariants

1. Thought operates on representations, not on reality directly.

2. Representations are necessary and irreducibly lossy.
   No representation fully preserves what it represents.

3. Because representations are lossy, certainty can never be 0% or 100%.
   Certainty always exists strictly between these extremes.

4. Action is required despite uncertainty.
   Waiting for complete certainty is not an option.

5. Because action relies on representations, trust is unavoidable.
   Trust cannot be eliminated, only hidden or displaced.

6. If trust is unavoidable, it must be explicit, scoped, bounded, and revisable.

## Core Distinctions

- Representations are tools, not authorities.
- Language is a form of representation, not the substrate of thought.
- Epistemic trust (reliability for a purpose) is distinct from moral or social trust.
- Confidence concerns appropriate reliance, not truth.

## Central Failure Mode

The primary failure mode addressed by this framework is silent overconfidence,
caused by mistaking representations for what they represent.

Examples include:
- treating metrics as reality
- treating models as guarantees
- treating explanations as proof
- treating analogies as truths

## Permitted Moves

The framework permits the following operations:

- Evaluating representations without adjudicating ultimate truth
- Annotating representations without modifying their content
- Calibrating confidence without rejecting utility
- Downgrading trust without discarding use
- Separating judgment from certainty

## Forbidden Moves

The framework explicitly forbids:

- Treating representations as authoritative by default
- Eliminating judgment through formalization
- Collapsing multiple ambiguity types into one
- Using representations beyond their scoped confidence
- Laundering judgment as certainty

## Judgment

Judgment is irreducible.
No representation, model, or protocol can remove the need for judgment.

The role of this framework is not to eliminate judgment,
but to make explicit where judgment enters,
bound its confidence,
and preserve its revisability.

## Canonical Metaphor

All representations are fingers pointing at the moon.
The framework exists to prevent confusing the finger for the moon.

## Non-Goals

This framework does not:
- determine truth
- enforce correctness
- require consensus
- eliminate ambiguity
- replace human responsibility

## Closing Constraint

Any use of this framework that claims to remove uncertainty,
eliminate trust, or replace judgment violates its core constraints.
