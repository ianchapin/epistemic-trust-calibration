# Normative Ambiguity

Normative ambiguity arises when values, goals, or criteria for success are unclear, implicit, or in conflict.

In these cases, disagreement is not about facts or representations alone, but about what *should* matter.

## What Normative Ambiguity Is

Normative ambiguity occurs when:
- goals are underspecified or unstated
- multiple values are in tension
- tradeoffs are implicit rather than explicit
- success criteria differ between stakeholders
- “better” or “worse” is assumed rather than defined

The ambiguity lies in values, not in meaning or measurement.

---

## Common Examples

Normative ambiguity often appears in cases such as:

- optimizing a system without agreeing on what “good” means
- evaluating outcomes without shared success criteria
- treating efficiency, safety, fairness, or growth as interchangeable
- assuming alignment where value tradeoffs exist
- debating decisions while holding different priorities

In these situations, people may agree on data and still disagree on conclusions.

## Why Normative Ambiguity Is Easy to Miss

Normative ambiguity is easy to miss because:
- values are often treated as obvious or universal
- technical language can obscure value judgments
- metrics can hide normative choices behind numbers
- disagreement may appear factual rather than ethical

As a result, value conflicts are often misdiagnosed as technical failures.

---

## Typical Failure Mode

The typical failure mode of normative ambiguity is **false objectivity**.

Decisions appear neutral or evidence-based while embedding unexamined values.

This can lead to:
- moralized disagreement
- misplaced authority
- resistance framed as ignorance
- decisions that surprise or alienate stakeholders

When values are hidden, accountability becomes unclear.

---

## What Normative Ambiguity Is Not

Normative ambiguity is not:
- bad faith
- irrationality
- lack of intelligence
- something that data alone can resolve

It reflects the fact that values are plural, contextual, and often in tension.

---

## Relationship to Other Ambiguity Types

Normative ambiguity often interacts with:

- **Mapping Ambiguity**, when metrics encode value judgments
- **Contextual Ambiguity**, when goals change across settings
- **Structural Ambiguity**, when tradeoffs are enforced by design

Typing normative ambiguity helps separate value disagreement from representational failure.

## How This Framework Treats Normative Ambiguity

This framework encourages:
- explicitly stating goals and values
- naming tradeoffs rather than hiding them
- avoiding the appearance of neutrality where none exists
- limiting confidence when values are unresolved
- preserving judgment and accountability

Normative ambiguity cannot be eliminated.
It can only be made visible.

## Practical Signal

If a disagreement persists despite shared facts and representations,
normative ambiguity is likely present.

In such cases, the appropriate move is not more analysis,
but explicit discussion of values and priorities.
