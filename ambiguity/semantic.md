# Semantic Ambiguity

Semantic ambiguity arises when the same words or symbols are used to refer to different meanings.

This is the most familiar form of ambiguity, but it is often underestimated because shared language can create the illusion of shared understanding.

## What Semantic Ambiguity Is

Semantic ambiguity occurs when:
- a term has multiple meanings
- different people associate different concepts with the same word
- meanings shift across domains or contexts

In these cases, agreement at the language level does not guarantee agreement at the representational level.

Two people can use the same words while pointing at different things.

---

## Common Examples

Words that frequently carry semantic ambiguity include:

- risk
- safety
- reliable
- accurate
- aligned
- fair
- confidence

These terms often feel precise, but their meanings depend heavily on background assumptions, domain knowledge, and context.

Disagreements involving these words are often not about facts, but about meaning.

## Why Semantic Ambiguity Is Easy to Miss

Semantic ambiguity is easy to overlook because:
- language feels transparent in everyday use
- fluent conversation creates a sense of mutual understanding
- social pressure discourages slowing down to clarify meaning

As a result, people often proceed as if agreement has been reached when it has not.

---

## Typical Failure Mode

The typical failure mode of semantic ambiguity is **false agreement**.

People believe they agree or disagree on a claim, when in fact they are operating with different meanings for key terms.

This can lead to:
- arguments that go in circles
- misplaced confidence
- moralized disagreement
- decisions based on misunderstood premises

## What Semantic Ambiguity Is Not

Semantic ambiguity is not:
- dishonesty
- bad faith
- lack of intelligence
- mere wordplay

It is a structural feature of language as a representation.

---

## Relationship to Other Ambiguity Types

Semantic ambiguity often co-occurs with other forms of ambiguity.

For example:
- a term may be clear semantically but misapplied contextually
- a shared definition may still hide mapping or structural ambiguity
- normative disagreement may be mistaken for semantic confusion

Typing semantic ambiguity does not resolve all disagreement.
It clarifies whether disagreement is *about meaning*.

## How This Framework Treats Semantic Ambiguity

This framework does not attempt to eliminate semantic ambiguity.

Instead, it encourages:
- explicitly naming when semantic ambiguity is present
- clarifying meanings where useful
- limiting confidence when meanings remain unresolved

When meanings cannot be aligned, judgment is required.
Pretending alignment exists when it does not increases risk.

## Practical Signal

If a discussion feels stuck despite apparent agreement on words,
semantic ambiguity is often present.

In such cases, the appropriate response is not persuasion,
but clarification or scoped trust.
