# Epistemic Trust Calibration

This repository contains a lightweight framework for calibrating how much trust representations deserve in a given context.

Representations include things like:
- models
- metrics
- explanations
- analogies
- summaries
- AI-generated outputs

The framework is designed for situations where uncertainty is unavoidable and action is still required.

## What This Is

This project provides:
- a set of core constraints that describe structural limits of thought and representation
- concepts for reasoning about trust, judgment, and uncertainty
- a simple taxonomy of ambiguity types
- a protocol for annotating representations without adjudicating truth
- speculative use cases to explore where the approach might or might not help

The focus is on **confidence allocation**, not belief enforcement.

---

## What This Is Not

This framework does not:
- determine what is true
- enforce correctness
- replace human judgment
- eliminate ambiguity
- require consensus
- act as an authority

It does not attempt to solve epistemology or automate decision-making.

---

## Core Idea

Humans think and act through representations rather than interacting with reality directly.

Because representations are necessary and imperfect:
- certainty is always bounded
- trust is unavoidable
- misuse often comes from overconfidence rather than malice

This framework treats representations as tools rather than authorities and focuses on making trust explicit, scoped, and revisable.

A common failure mode it addresses is mistaking representations for what they represent.

## How to Use This Repository

You do not need to agree with or adopt the entire framework to use it.

Suggested reading order:
1. `CORE_CONSTRAINTS.md`
2. `concepts/representations.md`
3. `ambiguity/README.md`
4. Individual ambiguity type pages
5. `use-cases/` (optional, speculative)

Each section is modular and intended to stand on its own.

## Design Principles

- Ambiguity is unavoidable and must be made explicit
- Trust must be scoped and revisable
- Judgment is irreducible and should not be hidden
- Representations are tools, not authorities
- Overreach is a failure mode

---

## Status

This is an evolving framework.

The core constraints are intended to be stable.
Other sections may change, expand, or be removed as the framework is tested and refined.
