# Trust

In this framework, *trust* refers to how much reliance a representation can reasonably bear for a given purpose.

Trust is not belief.
It is not agreement.
It is not endorsement.
It is not a moral judgment.

Trust is about use.

## Why Trust Is Unavoidable

Because we act through representations rather than directly on reality, trust cannot be eliminated.

Any decision, action, or inference implicitly assumes:
- some representations are reliable enough
- for some purposes
- under some conditions

Even refusing to trust a representation is itself a trust decision about alternatives.

The question is not whether trust exists, but whether it is:
- explicit or implicit
- bounded or unbounded
- revisable or frozen

---

## Trust Is Contextual

Trust is always scoped to a purpose.

A representation may be:
- trustworthy for exploration
- untrustworthy for decision-making
- useful for intuition
- inappropriate for justification
- adequate at low stakes
- dangerous at high stakes

Trust does not transfer automatically across uses.

Using a representation in a new context requires reassessing trust, not assuming continuity.

---

## Trust Is Not Belief

It is possible to:
- distrust a representation and still find it useful
- trust a representation for a narrow task without believing it is correct
- rely on a representation provisionally while remaining uncertain

Trust concerns *reliance*, not truth.

Belief answers the question:
> “Do I think this is true?”

Trust answers the question:
> “Is it appropriate to rely on this here?”

These questions are related but not interchangeable.

---

## Trust and Confidence

In this framework, confidence describes the *degree of reliance* that is appropriate.

Confidence is not a probability estimate.
It is not a measure of certainty.

Confidence answers questions like:
- How much weight should this representation carry?
- How much verification is required before acting?
- How costly would it be if this representation failed?

Confidence can decrease without discarding usefulness.

---

## Trust and Authority

A common failure mode occurs when representations are treated as authoritative by default.

Authority collapses trust into an all-or-nothing posture:
- trusted representations are treated as unquestionable
- distrusted representations are dismissed entirely

This framework rejects that collapse.

Trust is granular.
It admits partial reliance, conditional use, and revision over time.

---

## How This Framework Treats Trust

This framework aims to:
- make trust assumptions explicit
- scope trust to specific uses
- bound trust by known limits and failure modes
- preserve the ability to revise trust as conditions change

It does not attempt to determine what *should* be trusted.
It structures how trust is allocated and constrained.

---

## Practical Signal

If a representation is being used without anyone being able to say:
- why it is trusted
- for what purpose
- within what limits

then trust is present but implicit.

Implicit trust is not safer than explicit trust.
It is simply harder to see and harder to revise.
