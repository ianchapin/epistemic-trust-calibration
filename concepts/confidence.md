# Confidence

In this framework, *confidence* refers to how much reliance it is appropriate to place on a representation in a given context.

Confidence is not certainty.
It is not probability.
It is not belief strength.

Confidence is about *use*.

## Confidence Is About Reliance, Not Truth

Confidence answers questions such as:
- How much weight should this representation carry?
- How much verification is required before acting?
- How costly would failure be if this representation is wrong?
- How reversible is the decision based on it?

These questions are about action under uncertainty, not about whether a representation is true.

A representation can be useful even when confidence is low.
A representation can be dangerous even when confidence feels high.

## Confidence Is Contextual

Confidence is always relative to:
- the purpose of use
- the stakes involved
- the availability of alternatives
- the cost of being wrong
- the ability to revise later

A representation may warrant:
- high confidence in low-stakes exploration
- moderate confidence for informing discussion
- low confidence for high-stakes decisions

Confidence does not transfer automatically across contexts.

---

## Confidence Is Not Probability

Confidence is often mistaken for a probability estimate.

This framework does not require:
- numerical probabilities
- calibrated likelihoods
- confidence scores

Confidence is a qualitative judgment about reliance.

Attempting to force confidence into precise numbers can create a false sense of rigor and obscure underlying uncertainty.

## Confidence and Trust

Trust and confidence are closely related but distinct.

- **Trust** concerns whether reliance is appropriate at all.
- **Confidence** concerns how much reliance is appropriate.

A representation may be trusted but only with low confidence.
It may be distrusted for one use and trusted for another.

Separating trust from confidence allows for more granular and honest use.

## Confidence and Stakes

Confidence should decrease as stakes increase, unless compensating safeguards exist.

High confidence is easier to justify when:
- consequences are low
- decisions are reversible
- errors are easily detected

Low confidence is appropriate when:
- consequences are severe
- decisions are irreversible
- errors are costly or hidden

Ignoring the relationship between confidence and stakes is a common source of failure.

---

## Confidence Can Decrease Without Rejecting Usefulness

Reducing confidence does not mean discarding a representation.

It may mean:
- using it as one input among many
- requiring independent confirmation
- limiting its role to exploration
- delaying action
- explicitly marking uncertainty

Confidence calibration is about adjustment, not acceptance or rejection.

---

## How This Framework Treats Confidence

This framework aims to:
- separate confidence from truth claims
- prevent confidence from inflating silently
- tie confidence to context and stakes
- preserve the ability to revise confidence over time

It does not attempt to determine the correct level of confidence.
It makes confidence explicit and bounded.

---

## Practical Signal

If a representation is being treated as decisive without anyone addressing:
- stakes
- reversibility
- cost of error
- alternatives

confidence is likely being overextended.

In such cases, the appropriate move is not to argue correctness,
but to reassess how much reliance is being placed on the representation.
