# Contextual Ambiguity

Contextual ambiguity arises when a representation is used outside the context it was created for, or when its original scope is forgotten.

In these cases, the representation itself may be accurate or well-constructed, but its *use* becomes inappropriate.

---

## What Contextual Ambiguity Is

Contextual ambiguity occurs when:
- the original purpose of a representation is unclear or ignored
- assumptions tied to its creation are no longer valid
- a representation is reused in a different setting without reassessment

The ambiguity is not in the representation’s content, but in the relationship between the representation and its current use.

---

## Common Examples

Contextual ambiguity often appears when:

- an exploratory model is used for decision-making
- a diagnostic metric is used as a performance target
- an explanation meant for intuition is used as justification
- a summary intended for speed is used in high-stakes contexts
- an AI output meant to assist thinking is used to replace it

In each case, the same representation is asked to do work it was never designed to do.

---

## Why Contextual Ambiguity Is Easy to Miss

Contextual ambiguity is easy to overlook because:
- representations often look the same across contexts
- reuse feels efficient and convenient
- success in one context creates misplaced confidence in others

Over time, context drops away and the representation appears more general than it is.

---

## Typical Failure Mode

The typical failure mode of contextual ambiguity is **scope creep**.

A representation gradually accumulates authority as it moves across contexts, even though its reliability does not transfer with it.

This can lead to:
- overconfidence
- misuse
- brittle decision-making
- failures that are hard to diagnose after the fact

---

## What Contextual Ambiguity Is Not

Contextual ambiguity is not:
- misuse caused by bad faith
- a flaw in the representation itself
- lack of intelligence or care

It is a predictable consequence of reuse under uncertainty.

---

## Relationship to Other Ambiguity Types

Contextual ambiguity often co-occurs with:

- **Mapping Ambiguity**, when the relationship to reality changes across contexts
- **Structural Ambiguity**, when assumptions break under new conditions
- **Normative Ambiguity**, when values differ between contexts

Typing contextual ambiguity helps distinguish *where* a representation is failing, not *whether* it is correct.

---

## How This Framework Treats Contextual Ambiguity

This framework encourages:
- explicitly stating the intended context of a representation
- limiting confidence transfer across contexts
- reassessing trust when context changes
- marking where judgment is required to approve reuse

When context cannot be preserved or reconstructed, confidence should be reduced rather than assumed.

---

## Practical Signal

If a representation is being reused without anyone being able to clearly state:
- what it was designed for
- what assumptions it relies on
- what has changed since it was created

contextual ambiguity is likely present.

In such cases, the safest move is not rejection, but scoped trust.
