# Speculative Use Cases

This folder contains **speculative examples** of where the Epistemic Trust Calibration framework *might* be useful.

These are not prescriptions.
They are not endorsements.
They are not claims of correctness or effectiveness.

Each use case is intended as a thought experiment rather than a recommendation.

---

## Purpose of This Folder

The purpose of these examples is to:
- explore how trust calibration could apply in different contexts
- surface potential failure modes
- test whether the framework adds clarity or friction
- illustrate how ambiguity typing and confidence gating might work in practice

If a use case feels unhelpful, forced, or inappropriate, that is a valid outcome.

---

## Important Constraints

Use cases in this folder:
- do not claim general applicability
- do not override domain expertise
- do not replace responsibility or accountability
- do not guarantee better outcomes

They are explicitly incomplete and context-dependent.

---

## How to Read These Examples

When reading a use case, focus on:
- how representations are being relied upon
- where trust is implicitly assumed
- what kinds of ambiguity are present
- where judgment enters and cannot be removed

Do not treat these examples as templates or best practices.

---

## Relationship to the Framework

The framework itself is defined by its core constraints and concepts.

Use cases exist only to:
- test the framework’s boundaries
- reveal its limitations
- make abstract ideas concrete without asserting authority

If a use case appears to conflict with the core constraints, the use case is wrong.

---

## Adding New Use Cases

New use cases should:
- clearly state why the scenario is interesting
- identify common failure modes
- name relevant ambiguity types
- explicitly describe limits of applicability

Speculation is allowed.
Overreach is not.
