# Structural Ambiguity

Structural ambiguity arises from the inherent limits, assumptions, and simplifications built into a representation.

It exists even when meanings are clear, context is appropriate, and mappings are understood.

This ambiguity comes from the structure of the representation itself.

## What Structural Ambiguity Is

Structural ambiguity occurs when:
- a representation simplifies a system with many interacting parts
- assumptions are required to make the representation usable
- important variables or relationships are omitted
- boundaries are drawn that could reasonably be drawn differently

These limits are not errors.
They are the cost of abstraction.

## Common Examples

Structural ambiguity often appears in cases such as:

- models that assume independence where interactions exist
- frameworks that flatten continuous phenomena into categories
- summaries that omit edge cases to remain legible
- averages that hide variance and distribution shape
- rules that work well generally but fail in specific situations

Even when these representations are useful, their structure constrains what they can express.

## Why Structural Ambiguity Is Hard to Address

Structural ambiguity is difficult because:
- it cannot be resolved by clarification alone
- it persists even with perfect understanding
- improving one aspect often worsens another
- adding detail can destroy usability

Attempts to eliminate structural ambiguity often result in representations that are too complex to use.

---

## Typical Failure Mode

The typical failure mode of structural ambiguity is **false completeness**.

People assume that because a representation is detailed or formal, it captures everything that matters.

This can lead to:
- ignoring edge cases
- overconfidence in outputs
- surprise when rare but important events occur
- failures that appear “unpredictable” in hindsight

---

## What Structural Ambiguity Is Not

Structural ambiguity is not:
- a mistake in construction
- a lack of rigor
- something that disappears with more data
- evidence that the representation is invalid

It is an unavoidable result of choosing one structure over others.

---

## Relationship to Other Ambiguity Types

Structural ambiguity often underlies other ambiguity types:

- **Mapping Ambiguity**, when structural assumptions affect what is captured
- **Contextual Ambiguity**, when assumptions break in new settings
- **Semantic Ambiguity**, when structure is described imprecisely

Typing structural ambiguity helps identify limits that cannot be negotiated away.

## How This Framework Treats Structural Ambiguity

This framework encourages:
- explicitly stating core assumptions
- naming what the representation cannot express
- resisting claims of completeness
- limiting confidence in edge or high-stakes cases
- preserving judgment where structure runs out

Structural ambiguity marks the boundary where representations stop doing the work.

## Practical Signal

If a representation feels “complete” or “fully specified,” structural ambiguity is likely being overlooked.

In such cases, the safest response is not to add confidence, but to slow down and ask what the structure excludes.
