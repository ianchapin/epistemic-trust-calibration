# Representations

In this framework, a *representation* is anything that stands in for something else so that thinking, communication, or action is possible.

We do not interact with reality directly.
We interact through representations of it.

## What Counts as a Representation

Some representations are explicit:

- words
- numbers
- graphs
- metrics
- models
- equations
- diagrams

Others are implicit but equally important:

- mental images
- intuitions
- categories
- narratives
- rules of thumb
- emotional signals like “this feels risky”

Language is one way representations are expressed.
It is not the substrate of thought itself.

## Why Representations Are Necessary

Reality is too detailed, continuous, and complex to act on directly.

Representations allow us to:
- compress information
- abstract patterns
- generalize across situations
- make decisions under time and resource constraints

Without representations, thought and action would not be possible.

## Why Representations Are Always Imperfect

Every representation leaves something out.

This is not a flaw to be corrected.
It is a structural constraint.

A representation that preserved everything would be indistinguishable from what it represents, and therefore useless.

Because representations are lossy:
- distortion is unavoidable
- simplification is required
- error is always possible

## The Common Failure Mode

Problems arise when a representation is treated as if it *were* the thing it represents.

Examples:
- a metric treated as reality rather than a proxy
- a model treated as a guarantee rather than an approximation
- an explanation treated as proof rather than a story that fits
- an analogy treated as truth rather than guidance

This failure mode is often described by the saying:

> “Do not confuse the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself.”

The finger is necessary.
The finger is not the moon.

## Representations and Certainty

Because representations are imperfect, certainty is always bounded.

- Complete certainty would require perfect representation, which is impossible.
- Complete uncertainty would prevent thought or action altogether.

Certainty therefore always exists between these extremes.
It is provisional, contextual, and revisable.

## Representations and Trust

Because we rely on representations to act, trust is unavoidable.

Trust is not a moral judgment.
It is an assessment of how much reliance a representation can bear for a given purpose.

The question is not whether to trust a representation, but:
- how much
- for what use
- under what assumptions
- with what awareness of failure modes

This is what it means to calibrate trust.

## What This Framework Does With Representations

This framework does not attempt to improve representations directly.

Instead, it focuses on:
- making their limits explicit
- preventing silent overconfidence
- clarifying appropriate use
- preserving judgment where representations stop doing the work

Representations remain tools.
They are never treated as authorities.

## A Note on Language

This page uses language to describe representations.
That does not contradict the point being made.

Language is itself a representation.

The goal is not to escape representations.
The goal is to relate to them accurately.
