# Mapping Ambiguity

Mapping ambiguity arises when the relationship between a representation and what it refers to is unclear, indirect, or unstable.

In these cases, the ambiguity does not lie in the representation’s meaning or context alone, but in how it maps onto the thing it is meant to represent.

## What Mapping Ambiguity Is

Mapping ambiguity occurs when:
- a representation stands in for something complex or unobservable
- the relationship between the representation and reality is indirect
- changes in the world alter what the representation captures
- the strength or direction of the mapping is uncertain

The representation may be internally consistent and well-defined, while still failing to reliably reflect what it is assumed to represent.

---

## Common Examples

Mapping ambiguity often appears in cases such as:

- a metric used as a proxy for quality, success, or health
- a model output assumed to correspond directly to real-world outcomes
- a score or ranking treated as a measure of underlying value
- a signal interpreted as evidence of a hidden property

In each case, the representation is only loosely coupled to the underlying phenomenon.

## Why Mapping Ambiguity Is Easy to Miss

Mapping ambiguity is easy to miss because:
- representations often produce precise outputs
- numerical or formal structure creates a sense of rigor
- the mapping works well enough in familiar conditions

As long as the mapping appears stable, its limits remain invisible.

Problems often surface only when conditions change or stakes increase.

## Typical Failure Mode

The typical failure mode of mapping ambiguity is **overinterpretation**.

People assume:
- the representation captures more than it does
- small changes in the representation reflect meaningful changes in reality
- the mapping is stable across contexts and time

This can lead to:
- misplaced confidence
- false precision
- decisions based on fragile signals
- difficulty diagnosing failure when outcomes diverge

---

## What Mapping Ambiguity Is Not

Mapping ambiguity is not:
- a bug in the representation
- evidence of incompetence
- proof that the representation is useless

It is a consequence of using proxies and abstractions in complex systems.

---

## Relationship to Other Ambiguity Types

Mapping ambiguity often co-occurs with:

- **Structural Ambiguity**, when simplifying assumptions affect what is captured
- **Contextual Ambiguity**, when mappings shift across use cases
- **Semantic Ambiguity**, when the nature of the mapping is described imprecisely

Typing mapping ambiguity helps distinguish failures of *representation* from failures of *interpretation*.

---

## How This Framework Treats Mapping Ambiguity

This framework encourages:
- explicitly stating what a representation is a proxy for
- naming what the representation does not capture
- limiting confidence based on mapping strength
- reducing reliance when mappings are unstable or poorly understood

The goal is not to perfect the mapping, but to prevent it from silently carrying more trust than it can support.

---

## Practical Signal

If a representation is being used as evidence of something that cannot be directly observed or measured, mapping ambiguity is likely present.

In such cases, confidence should be calibrated to the strength and stability of the mapping, not to the clarity of the output.
